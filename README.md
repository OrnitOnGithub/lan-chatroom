## **How to Use**:
There are no releases yet, so download this repository by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/ornitongithub/lan-chatroom
```
in your terminal. You can also just click on `Code > Download zip` on GitHub if that's easier for you.

Open the folder you just downloaded or cloned.

Set your username by editing `username.txt`

Install the dependencies
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
If that doesn't work, try:
```
pip3 install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org flask --user 
```
If this **STILL** doesn't work, make sure you're using python interpret 3.10+

Run `main.py`. Either by running it in VSCode or by running
```
python3 main.py
```
in your terminal.

Normally a browser window should open automatically. If it does not, edit these lines in `main.py`:
```python
open_browser = True     # Wether the app will open your browser for you
browser = "safari"      #Â Which browser to open.
```
If you do not want the app to automatically open the browser for you, you must visit `localhost:5000` by yourself after starting `main.py`

Now that your browser opened the app, you can start chatting.

If your browser says "page not found" or anything along those lines, just try reloading the page. This is a pseudo race condition between the browser openning and the web app starting.

To close the app, press `ctrl+c` in your terminal.

If you want to change port, edit `port.txt`. Default is `12345`.

/!\ **WARNING:** You will only recieve and see messages that are sent while the script is running on your computer.

/!\ **WARNING:** Both you and all recipients must be connected to the same network.
