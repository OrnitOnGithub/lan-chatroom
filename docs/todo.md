# High-level TODO

## I should do this
- [x] Fix message getting reset issue
- [x] Make GUI
- [x] Make username.txt more restrictive
- [x] Ping to find users
  - [x] Display list of users
- [x] Colour
- [x] Encryption
  - [x] Rewrite network.py
    - Switch to TCP
  - [x] Encrypt
- [x] Some form of versioning?
- [ ] Write docs

## I won't do these, but if a contributor wants to, sure.

- [ ] Make pinging also check for correct encryption key
- [ ] Asymmetric encryption
- [ ] Add a dark mode toggle
- [ ] Every second the frontend refreshes to update with the backend. If someone can write code that satisfies the following conditions, I'd be very grateful.
  - The text box automatically scrolls down when a new message is sent, unless you've scrolled up to look at other messages
  - Instead of polling, the frontent should be updated every time a new message is recieved.
- [ ] Line wrapping in the UI
- [ ] Make the UI look nicer
## This WON'T be done

- Banning users
