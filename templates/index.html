                    Hello and welcome to the chatroom. <br>
                    <br>
                    We are currently even before the alpha release so
                    you might encounter a few issues using this chatroom. <br>
                    A current known issue is a race condition between the network
                    library and the flask web app, sometimes resulting in
                    spontaneously clearing the chat. <br>
                    The networking library is quite a mess and may cause some problems of its own. <br>
                    <br>
                    Also, as was mentioned in the README, you cannot see chats from before you joined the chatroom. <br>
                    <br>
                    If you want to report issues, please do so here <a href="https://github.com/OrnitOnGithub/lan-chatroom/issues">here</a>. <br>
                    <br>
                    Thank you.
