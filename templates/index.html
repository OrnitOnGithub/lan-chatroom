                    Hello and welcome to the chatroom. <br>
                    <br>
                    A list of all online users will be displayed here at some point. <br>
                    <br>
                    We are currently even before the alpha release so
                    you might encounter a few issues using this chatroom. <br>
                    A current known issue is a race condition between the network
                    library and the flask web app, sometimes resulting in
                    spontaneously clearing the chat. <br>
                    The networking library is quite a mess and may cause some problems of its own. <br>
                    <br>
                    If you want to report issues, first of all check the todo list
                    to make sure this isn't already planned, and then please do so
                    <a href="https://github.com/OrnitOnGithub/lan-chatroom/issues">here</a>. <br>
                    <br>
                    Any extra information can be found in the README file. If you're having trouble,
                    read it. <br>
                    <br>
                    Thank you.
