## Message reset issue

### IDEA 1

Just do GUI
- ~~Pygame (no)~~
- ~~Tkinter~~
- Web gooey
  - **Localhost web app (Flask)**
  - ~~Built-in web app (doesnt seem to work on school laptops though)~~

## Pinging

How should we know who's online and who isn't?

### IDEA 1

Every `X` seconds, everyone broadcasts their username on the port.

every computer then appends that username to a list.

For each username, if it wasn't recieved in an timeframe arbitrarily larger than `X` seconds, that user can be considered offline.

EXAMPLE IN JSON
```json
[

    {
        "username" : "Ornit",
        "time_since_ping" : 9
    },
    {
        "username" : "Fortnite",
        "time_since_ping" : 4
    }
]
```

###Â IDEA 2

Pings. If someone recieves a ping, they will respond, notifying that someone of their presence.

## Message Synchronisation

### IDEA 1

Every message has an associated time to go with it. Then, every user iterates through every other user's message history and takes all messages, arranges them chronologically, removes duplicates and boom! A more accurate message history.
